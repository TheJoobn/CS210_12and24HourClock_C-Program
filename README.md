# CS210_12and24HourClock_C-Program

Instructions
Before you submit your project code, you will be able to get feedback from an instant feedback tool (Sense). Sense is not a compiler and should not be used as one. It is designed to give you feedback on how well parts of your code meet assignment requirements and some tips on how you may improve the code that you wrote. The tool will allow you to submit each function that you write for instant feedback on your code for this assignment. This allows you to refine your code before submitting the assignment for grading by your instructor. Note: You may need to write some code that is not covered by the tool based on how you decide to write your program. The feedback covers most of the functional requirements. 

Each of the feedback tool steps is one piece of the functional requirements for your project based on the project requirements documents.  You may submit your code as many times as you like to Sense to help you refine your code. You will still need to submit your final program to the Brightspace link for your completed assignment.

Submit your project here. Make sure you've included all the required elements by reviewing the requirements and rubric.

Write a function that displays BOTH 12- and 24-hour time formats on the interface at the same time. Get feedback on how well my function works and tips on how to make it better.

Write main function (main.cpp) to control your program. The feedback  will be limited to the logic in main and not for any input or return values from your functions. It will test to see that all are called the correct number of times. Get feedback on how well my function works and tips on how to make it better.
